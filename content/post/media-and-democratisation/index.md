title: Media and democratisation: What is known about the role of mass media in transitions to democracy
date: '2024-06-22'
summary: Media is widely recognized as a key player in the democratization process. A long-term macroscopic study focusing on Austria from 1816 to 1932 provides compelling evidence for this relationship. Through data analysis of Viennese media content, researchers found a significant correlation between the increased attention to democratic ideals in the media and the rising levels of democratization in the country.
